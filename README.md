**Artificial Intelligence Challenges** </br>
Four challenges taken by the students of the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning course at ‘Politecnico Di Bari’. 
The aim of these challenges is to test both theoretical knowledge and coding skills about Artificial Intelligence topics covered in the lessons. 
The students had 2 hours and half for each challenge to implement a solution using Artificial Intelligence principles and algorithms. <br/>
<br/>

The topics covered by these challenges are:<br/>
**Search strategies**: uninformed search and informed search.
Uninformed search using breadth-first search, uniform-cost search, depth-first search, depth-limited search, iterative deepening depth-first search, bidirectional search.  
Informed search using greedy best-first search, A* search.

**Constraint Satisfaction Problems**: backtracking strategy and local search strategies based on Minimum Remaining Values heuristic, Degree heuristic, Least Constraint Value heuristic, Forward Checking strategy and Arc Consistency strategy.

**Adversarial search**: minimax algorithm, alfa-beta pruning technique, search cutting.

**Prolog problem modeling** using backtracking search strategy to resolve a Constraint Satisfaction Problem. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Each challenge is briefly described below:
- **LOCAL SEARCH CHALLENGE**: based on a maze composed by a rectangular grid having specific positions occupied by walls. The problem to solve is to find the shortest path implementing 3 different search strategies: Breadth First, Depth First, A*, satisfying specific rules.
- **AI CSP CHALLENGE**: based on a constraint satisfaction problem, solved implementing Backtracking-Search algorithm and Local Search. The problem to solve is not to overcome the maximum capacity of each container, distributing items in different containers within the constraints imposed by the problem itself.
- **MINIMAX CHALLENGE**: based on the movements of two opposed agents on a 2D board. Giving a define set of rules, the problem to solve is modeling the game using minimax algorithm, implementing alpha-beta pruning to the search tree.
- **PROLOG CHALLENGE**: showing all the possible solutions for the escape of few individuals, from a place covered with traps using Prolog.
